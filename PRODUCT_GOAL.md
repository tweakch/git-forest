# 🎯 Product Goal — *git-forest*

**git-forest enables development teams to systematically transform fragmented Git work (branches, fixes, refactors) into durable, high-quality software by treating change as a living system.**
It turns branches into *plants*, plans into *growth rules*, and AI agents (*planners* and *planters*) into long-term caretakers that continuously evolve, verify, and harden code until intent is fully realized and sustainably integrated.

**Outcome:**
A self-tending codebase that preserves intent, reduces hidden technical debt, and compounds quality over time—shifting teams from “merge and forget” to *cultivate and harvest*.
