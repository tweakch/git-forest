  Prevent context loss across long refactor cycles.
  This plan maintains context and continuity across extended refactoring
  efforts, ensuring AI agents and developers don't lose important decisions,
  constraints, or progress made in earlier phases.

focus_areas:
  - Track refactoring context across sessions
  - Preserve decision history and rationale
  - Maintain constraint awareness
  - Document progress and completed steps
  - Link related refactoring efforts
  - Prevent duplicate or conflicting work
