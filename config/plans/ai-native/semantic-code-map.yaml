  Build a knowledge graph of the repo.
  This plan creates a semantic understanding of the codebase by building a
  knowledge graph that captures relationships, concepts, and patterns for
  AI-assisted development.

focus_areas:
  - Extract semantic relationships from code
  - Build component dependency graph
  - Map business concepts to code
  - Identify design patterns and idioms
  - Create searchable code knowledge base
  - Enable semantic code navigation
