  Keep diagrams, ADRs, and code aligned.
  This plan ensures architectural documentation stays synchronized with the
  actual codebase through automated validation and continuous updates.

focus_areas:
  - Validate architecture diagrams against code
  - Keep ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) current
  - Ensure code reflects documented architecture
  - Detect architecture drift
  - Update diagrams when code changes
  - Maintain architecture documentation

scopes:
  - architecture
  - documentation
  - alignment

planners:
  - architecture-drift-detector
  - adr-validator
  - diagram-sync-checker

planters:
  - architecture-updater
  - diagram-maintainer
