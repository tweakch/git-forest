  Target complex methods and split responsibilities.
  This plan identifies methods and functions with high cyclomatic complexity and
  proposes refactorings to simplify logic, improve readability, and reduce maintenance burden.

focus_areas:
  - Identify high-complexity methods (cyclomatic complexity > 10)
  - Split complex methods into smaller, focused functions
  - Reduce nested conditionals and loops
  - Extract business logic into separate methods
  - Improve code readability and testability
  - Apply single responsibility principle

scopes:
  - code-quality
  - refactoring
  - maintainability

planners:
  - complexity-analyzer
  - method-complexity-scanner
  - cognitive-load-detector

planters:
  - complexity-reducer
  - method-splitter
  - logic-extractor
