  Find unreachable, unused, or legacy code paths.
  This plan identifies and safely removes dead code, including unused functions, unreachable
  code blocks, obsolete classes, and legacy code paths that are no longer executed.

focus_areas:
  - Detect unused functions and methods
  - Identify unreachable code blocks
  - Find obsolete classes and interfaces
  - Locate unused imports and dependencies
  - Detect feature flags for removed features
  - Remove commented-out code
  - Clean up legacy migration code

scopes:
  - code-quality
  - maintenance
  - cleanup

planners:
  - dead-code-detector
  - usage-analyzer
  - reachability-analyzer

planters:
  - dead-code-remover
  - cleanup-agent
