  Reduce transitive dependencies, pin versions, and remove unused packages.
  This plan ensures your dependency graph stays clean, secure, and maintainable by
  identifying unnecessary dependencies, managing version constraints, and preventing
  dependency bloat.

focus_areas:
  - Identify and remove unused dependencies
  - Reduce transitive dependency chains
  - Pin critical dependency versions
  - Update outdated dependencies safely
  - Prevent dependency duplication
  - Analyze dependency tree complexity

scopes:
  - dependencies
  - maintenance
  - security

planners:
  - dependency-analyzer
  - unused-package-detector
  - version-drift-scanner

planters:
  - dependency-pruner
  - version-updater
  - package-consolidator
