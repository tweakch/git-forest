  Config, scaling, resilience for cloud targets.
  This plan prepares applications for cloud deployment by implementing
  cloud-native patterns including externalized configuration, horizontal
  scaling, and resilience patterns.

focus_areas:
  - Externalize configuration
  - Implement health checks and readiness probes
  - Enable horizontal scaling
  - Add cloud-native logging and monitoring
  - Implement graceful shutdown
  - Use cloud storage services

scopes:
  - cloud
  - migration
  - infrastructure
