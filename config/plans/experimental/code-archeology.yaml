  Discover why things exist.
  This plan excavates the history of code to understand the original context,
  decisions, and constraints that led to the current implementation, revealing
  valuable insights often lost in time.

focus_areas:
  - Analyze git history for context
  - Extract original requirements from commits
  - Identify historical constraints
  - Discover forgotten design decisions
  - Link code to original issues/discussions
  - Understand evolution of components

scopes:
  - history
  - understanding
  - documentation

planners:
  - history-analyzer
  - context-extractor
  - evolution-tracker

planters:
  - archeologist
  - context-documenter
