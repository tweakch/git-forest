description: |
  Enforce global complexity limits.
  This plan establishes and enforces complexity budgets at various levels
  (method, class, module, system) to prevent complexity creep and maintain
  long-term maintainability.

focus_areas:
  - Define complexity budgets per level
  - Monitor complexity metrics continuously
  - Alert on budget violations
  - Prevent complexity creep
  - Refactor to stay within budget
  - Track complexity trends over time

scopes:
  - quality
  - complexity
  - maintainability

planners:
  - complexity-budget-calculator
  - budget-monitor
  - trend-analyzer

planters:
  - complexity-enforcer
  - budget-maintainer
