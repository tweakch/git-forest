  Fight gradual degradation.
  This plan combats software entropy by continuously identifying and fixing
  small degradations before they accumulate into major technical debt,
  maintaining system health over time.

focus_areas:
  - Detect early signs of degradation
  - Identify entropy patterns
  - Fix small issues before they grow
  - Maintain consistent code quality
  - Prevent technical debt accumulation
  - Monitor system health trends

scopes:
  - quality
  - maintenance
  - prevention

planners:
  - entropy-detector
  - degradation-monitor
  - health-tracker

planters:
  - entropy-fighter
  - quality-maintainer
