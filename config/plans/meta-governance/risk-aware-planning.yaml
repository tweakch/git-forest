  Rank plants by blast radius.
  This plan assesses and prioritizes plants based on their potential impact
  and risk, ensuring high-risk changes receive appropriate scrutiny and
  low-risk changes can proceed quickly.

focus_areas:
  - Calculate blast radius for each plant
  - Assess change risk and impact
  - Prioritize based on risk/value ratio
  - Require appropriate reviews for high-risk changes
  - Enable fast-track for low-risk changes
  - Monitor risk distribution across plants

  - governance
