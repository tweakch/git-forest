  Enforce response time SLOs per boundary.
  This plan establishes and enforces latency budgets for different service boundaries,
  ensuring predictable performance and identifying operations that exceed their budgets.

focus_areas:
  - Define latency budgets for service boundaries
  - Monitor operation latency against budgets
  - Identify operations exceeding budgets
  - Add performance tests with latency assertions
  - Track latency distributions (p50, p95, p99)
  - Alert on budget violations

scopes:
  - performance
  - monitoring
  - slo
