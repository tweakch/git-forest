  Optimize async pipelines, batching, and parallelism.
  This plan identifies opportunities to improve system throughput through better use of
  async/await patterns, request batching, and parallel processing.

focus_areas:
  - Identify synchronous blocking in async contexts
  - Implement batching for bulk operations
  - Add parallelism for independent operations
  - Optimize async/await patterns
  - Implement pipeline processing
  - Reduce lock contention

scopes:
  - performance
  - concurrency
  - optimization
