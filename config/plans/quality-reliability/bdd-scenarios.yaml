  Capture critical behaviors as scenarios and (optionally) automate them.
  This plan emphasizes clear, shared language, executable specifications, and
  end-to-end behavioral coverage for high-value user and system workflows.

focus_areas:
  - Define scenarios for key user journeys and system behaviors
  - Align domain language and acceptance criteria across team and code
  - Identify gaps where behavior is undocumented or ambiguous
  - Automate scenarios that guard critical workflows
  - Ensure scenarios remain stable, readable, and maintainable
  - Improve traceability from scenario to implementation and tests

scopes:
  - bdd
  - specifications
  - acceptance
  - documentation
  - test-automation
