  Inject failures (timeouts, retries, partial outages) to test system resilience.
  This plan helps build resilient systems by introducing controlled chaos experiments,
  testing failure scenarios, and ensuring graceful degradation.

focus_areas:
  - Test timeout handling and retry logic
  - Simulate partial service outages
  - Validate circuit breaker implementations
  - Test fallback mechanisms
  - Verify graceful degradation
  - Validate error handling paths

scopes:
  - reliability
  - resilience
  - testing
