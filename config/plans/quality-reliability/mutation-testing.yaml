  Strengthen weak tests by introducing mutations.
  This plan uses mutation testing to identify weaknesses in your test suite by introducing
  small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if tests catch them. Surviving
  mutations indicate areas where tests need improvement.

focus_areas:
  - Run mutation testing on critical code paths
  - Identify surviving mutations (weak tests)
  - Add tests to kill surviving mutations
  - Improve assertion quality
  - Increase mutation score
  - Focus on business-critical components

scopes:
  - testing
  - quality
  - coverage
