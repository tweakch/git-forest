  Improve logs, metrics, and traces completeness.
  This plan enhances system observability by ensuring comprehensive logging, meaningful
  metrics, and distributed tracing coverage across all critical paths.

focus_areas:
  - Add structured logging to critical paths
  - Implement meaningful business metrics
  - Add distributed tracing spans
  - Improve log message quality
  - Add performance counters
  - Ensure correlation ID propagation
