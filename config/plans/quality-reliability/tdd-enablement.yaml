  Make test-driven development practical by reducing feedback-loop friction.
  This plan focuses on speeding up the red/green/refactor cycle, improving determinism,
  and encouraging design-for-testability via small, safe refactors.

focus_areas:
  - Reduce test runtime for fast feedback
  - Improve determinism and remove sources of flakiness
  - Standardize test naming and structure for readability
  - Reduce fixture/setup complexity
  - Introduce seams for hard-to-test code paths
  - Improve developer ergonomics (filters, categories, targeted runs)
  - Encourage small, incremental refactoring guided by tests

scopes:
  - tdd
  - test-runner
  - determinism
  - refactoring
