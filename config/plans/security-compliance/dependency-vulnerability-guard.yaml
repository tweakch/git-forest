  CVE scanning and mitigation plans.
  This plan continuously monitors dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs),
  assesses their impact, and proposes mitigation strategies including updates,
  patches, or workarounds.

focus_areas:
  - Scan dependencies for known CVEs
  - Assess vulnerability severity and impact
  - Prioritize vulnerability remediation
  - Update vulnerable dependencies
  - Apply security patches
  - Implement workarounds for unfixable vulnerabilities

scopes:
  - security
  - dependencies
  - vulnerability-management

planners:
  - cve-scanner
  - vulnerability-assessor
  - remediation-planner

  - vulnerability-patcher
  - dependency-updater
