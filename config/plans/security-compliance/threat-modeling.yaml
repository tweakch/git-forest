  Surface attack vectors and trust boundaries.
  This plan identifies potential security threats by analyzing system architecture,
  identifying trust boundaries, and documenting attack vectors that need protection.

focus_areas:
  - Identify trust boundaries in the system
  - Map data flows across boundaries
  - Identify potential attack vectors
  - Document threat scenarios (STRIDE)
  - Validate authentication/authorization points
  - Analyze external input handling

scopes:
  - security
  - architecture
  - risk-management

planners:
  - threat-detector
  - boundary-analyzer
  - attack-vector-mapper

planters:
  - threat-documenter
  - security-hardener
